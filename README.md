# MNIST
This project is a quick first project that I did to practice working with Deep Learning and the Tensorflow librairy.
The dataset used here is the MNIST dataset, provided by Yann Lecun, that I used to train a model that I created of image classification.

As a student that comes close to the end of his study, the deep learning course had a great impact on me, and I am dedicated to pursue my career in the Computer Vision field.
This project will be the first of, I hope, many more to come, allowing me to increase my knowledge in this growing and fascinating field.
